➡️ Please note that I did not implement the case to ask the user if he wants to buy another drink. 
    If not then he would receive the change, in this case use will only receive remaining coins if he cancels the order.
    
➡️ Reason is because in the requirements it says that we don't want any interactive keyboard input.

➡️ Unit testing wasn't implemented due to requirement, however if theres some doubt in my testing skills or any other programming related doubt, use pricing-app repo as reference, since is another assessement that I just uploaded.
